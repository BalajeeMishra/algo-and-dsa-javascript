Searching is faster in avl tree because it is more height balanced but insertion and deletion is faster in red black tree.



                                         Insertion in Red Black Tree
                                         
        * If tree is empty then create new node as root node with color black.
        *If tree is not empty then create new node as leaf node with color red.
        * if parent of new node is black then exit 
        * If parent of new node is red then check the color of parent siblings of new node
                a) If color is black or null then do suitable rotation and recolor
                b)If color is red then recolor and also check parent's parent of new node is not root node then recolor it and recheck.
